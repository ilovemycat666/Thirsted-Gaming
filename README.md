Fiverr Work for Thirsted Gaming
Thirsted Gaming is a Call of Duty pay-to-play tournament site that rewards top teams with prizes. 
I designed a scoreboard that was hosted on their shopify site. The scoreboard pulled data from cod.tracker parsed and published it onto Thirsted Gaming. 
The scoreboard is broken into two halves for pro and am gamers. The scoreboard orders the teams by their overall score and also displayed other relevant statistics per team.
